# Step 1: Curate a diverse dataset comprising speech samples
# For example, you can use the LJ Speech dataset
# Download the LJ Speech dataset and load speech samples

# Step 2: Preprocess the dataset
# Perform data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation
# Example preprocessing steps:
# - Data cleaning (remove noise, silence, etc.)
# - Normalization (normalize audio levels)
# - Augmentation (pitch shifting, time stretching, speed perturbation, etc.)

# Step 3: Explore innovative techniques
# Implement prosody modeling techniques
# Explore neural network architectures (e.g., WaveNet, Tacotron)
# Investigate data-driven methodologies for improving TTS synthesis quality

# Step 4: Evaluate methodologies
# Perform subjective listening tests
# Collect human judgments on speech quality, naturalness, etc.
# Conduct objective metrics assessments (e.g., MOS, SNR, PESQ)
# Compare synthesized speech with human speech and baseline TTS models

# Additional steps:
# - Iterate on methodologies based on evaluation results
# - Fine-tune models based on user feedback and research findings
# - Document findings and insights from the evaluation process

# Note: The code provided here is an outline of the steps involved.
# Detailed implementation will require specific libraries, datasets, and model architectures.
